/** 
Problem Statement#
Given an array of intervals representing â€˜Nâ€™ appointments, 
find out if a person can attend all the appointments.

Example 1:
Appointments: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
Output: false
Explanation: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, a person cannot attend both of these appointments.

Example 2:
Appointments: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]]
Output: true
Explanation: None of the appointments overlap, therefore a person can attend all of them.
