// Problem Statement#
// Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place.
// You should treat numbers of the array as objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s,
// and 2s to recreate the array.
// The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and
// since our input array also consists of three different numbers that
// is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.
// Example 1:
// Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
// Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
/**
 *
 * @param {number[]} arr - array of 0s,1s and 2s only
